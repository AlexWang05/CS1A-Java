# CS1A-Foothill

Hello! Welcome to my Code Collection for my CS1A course at Foothill College, 
feel free to view and suggest edits to any of my projects as I am a high school student who can barely program.

Many of these programs have bugs or could be optimized, so if you are a fellow classmate, please do not try to copy this code
as some would not lead to perfect scores.

Thanks for reading, have fun viewing my badly-written code!
